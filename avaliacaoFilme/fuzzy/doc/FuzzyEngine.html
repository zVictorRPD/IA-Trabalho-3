<h1>
Fuzzy Engine for Java</h1></center>
<center><font size="-4">Version 0.2</font></center>

<blockquote>This fuzzy rule-based system is designed to perform fuzzy evaluations
in Java programs. The <a href="http://www.clarkson.edu/~esazonov/FuzzyEngine.htm"> original </a> code was designed by <a href="mailto:esazonov@usa.com">Edward S. Sazonov</a> (esazonov@usa.com).  Here is a description of <a href="versions.txt">modifications</a>. These version was developed by <a href="mailto:naz-irizarry@excite.com">Nazario Irizarry</a> .<p>

This is not a fuzzy system shell but rather a set of classes
and methods allowing evaluation of fuzzy rules given in the symbolic form.
This implementation of the engine allows tight integration of fuzzy reasoning into Java. All evaluations are performed
by the fuzzy engine in Java and manipulation of the control flow and input-output
operations are also performed in Java. Such a structure allows significantly
higher performance than a shell concept. The engine supports evaluation
of fuzzy rules in the symbolic form; fuzzy and/or/not operations; arbitrary
nesting of fuzzy expressions in the left part of a rule; multiple assignment
operations in the right part of a rule; predefined and user-defined hedges;
unconditional assignment operations; dynamically weighted rules.<p>

<a id="lvs"></a><h1>Linguistic Variables and Membership Functions</h1></center>

<blockquote>Linguistic variables closely interact with
both Java code and fuzzy rules. The same linguistic variable can participate
in fuzzy evaluations performed by different fuzzy engines. Each fuzzy assignment
will be accounted for during defuzzification. Each linguistic variable
has an arbitrary number of associated membership functions: each membership
function is represented by a trapezoid. Trapezoidal membership functions
allow simple implementation of the most widely used forms: rectangle, triangle
and trapezoid.
<p>Creating a linguistic variable takes two steps:

<blockquote>1. Allocation of a linguistic variable
<br><b>Example: </b><code>LinguisticVariable angle = Factory.makeLinguisticVariable("angle");</code>
<br>The String argument is the name/label of this particular linguistic
variable in the rules (<code>if angle is ...</code>).
<p>2. Definition of membership functions
<br><b>Example: </b><code>angle.add("negative", -3.14, -3.14, 0.0314, 0);</code></blockquote>
"Negative" here is the name which will be used to address this membership
function (<code>if angle is negative ...</code>), other four parameters define four
key points of a trapezoid. They follow in the order of left bottom, left
top, right top and right bottom points.</blockquote>

<a id="hedges"></a><h1>Hedges</h1></center>

<blockquote>Hedges allow to express different degrees of membership in
a fuzzy set. The package has three predefined hedges:
<blockquote>"not" -<img SRC="image002.gif" height=24 width=83>
<br>"very" -<img SRC="image004.gif" height=27 width=72>
<br>"somewhat" -<img SRC="image006.gif" height=27 width=100></blockquote>
Arbitrary hedges can be defined by deriving classes from the base class
Hedge. Method <code>getName()</code> should return a string containing the hedge name.
Method <code>hedgeIt()</code> should perform the desired hedge operation.</blockquote>

<center>
<a id="rules"></a><h2>Fuzzy Rules</h2></center>

<blockquote>All fuzzy evaluations are based on the rules in the symbolic
representation. Linguistic variables, membership functions, hedges and
fuzzy operations are referenced by their respective symbolic names. Symbolic
representation of the rules allows easy understanding of the rules and
simplifies the debugging process. Fuzzy rules are represented by text strings
in the following format:
<blockquote><tt>&lt;label> if LV1 is &lt;hedge ...> MF1 &lt;and/or LV2
is &lt;hedge ...> MF2 and/or ...> then LVN is &lt;hedge ...> MFN ... &lt;
and rule label weight is &lt;hedge ...> weightMF></tt>
<p><tt>&lt;label> set LV1 is &lt;hedge ...> MF1 &lt;and LV2 is &lt;hedge
...> MF2 ...> &lt;and rule label weight is &lt;hedge ...> weightMF></tt></blockquote>
<b>"label"</b> - a text label assigned to a rule. A rule's weight (default
is 1.0) is changed by executing expression <tt>"rule label weight is weightMF"</tt>
in the right part of a rule. The same label can be assigned to more than
one rule. In this case weight change will affect all of the labeled rules.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <code>start: if angle is ...</code></blockquote>
<b>"if"</b> - a service word indicating the beginning of the left part
(evaluation part) of a fuzzy rule.
<p><b>"LV"</b> - a linguistic variable. Linguistic variables are addressed
by their names. Each linguistic variable has one or more associated membership
functions.
<p><b>"is"</b> - a service word separating linguistic variable and hedges/membership
function.
<p><b>"hedge"</b> - the engine has 3 predefined hedges: "not", "very" and
"somewhat". The user can define arbitrary hedges and use them in rules.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <code>if weather is not very
nice ...</code></blockquote>
<b>"MF"</b> - a membership function. Membership functions are addressed
by their names. Each membership function is defined as a trapezoid.
<p><b>"and/or"</b> - service words indicating logical operation to be performed
on the neighboring fuzzy expressions. Priority of the and/or operations
decreases from left to right and may be changed by applying parenthesis.
The engine supports arbitrary number of expressions on the left part, arbitrary
nesting and and/or operations.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <code>if angle is wide or (angle is normal and
(speed is high or speed is normal)) ...</code></blockquote>
<b>"then"</b> - a service word separating left part of expression from
the right part (execution part). Result obtained from evaluation of the
left part is used to perform fuzzy assignments in the right part. The form
of fuzzy expressions is the same as in the evaluation part, except assignment
is performed instead of evaluation. During the assignment, hedges apply
to the result of evaluation part. Application of the hedges is local for
each fuzzy expression. If more than one assignment is to be performed,
then fuzzy expression should separated by the service word <b>"and"</b>
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>...then power is very low and steering
is toTheLeft</tt></blockquote>
<b>"rule"</b> - a service word indication that a rule's weight will be
changed in this expression. This word is followed by a label for the rule
whose weight is about to be changed.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>... then rule start: weight is low ...</tt></blockquote>
<b>"weight"</b> - this is a reserved linguistic variable. Linguistic variable
<b>"weight"</b>
is defined by the user and serves for the purpose of changing a rule's
weight. A copy of this LV is created for each unique label. Changes of
weight are performed by defuzzification of the copy assigned to a particular
label, thus multiple weight changes are carried out in fuzzy manner. How
much a rule's weight will be changed depends both on definition of membership
functions for <b>"weight"</b>, evaluation result after application of hedges
and number of assignments.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>LinguisticVariable weight= Factory.makeLinguisticVariable("weight");</tt>
<br><tt>weight.add("low",0,0,0.2,0.3);</tt>
<br><tt>...</tt>
<br><tt>fuzzyEngine.evaluateRule("start: if angle is wide then rule start:
weight is low");</tt></blockquote>
&nbsp;When weight assignment is performed on the same rule that assigns
the weight (see Example) then only one iteration of weight change is performed,
i.e. it does not fall into an endless loop of weight change.
<p><b>"set"</b> - a service word for unconditional assignments. If <b>"set"</b>
is encountered instead of <b>"if"</b>, result of the left part evaluation
is assumed to be 1.0 and all assignments are performed for that value.
<blockquote><b>Example:</b> <tt>set power is low ...</tt></blockquote>

<a id="eval"></a><h1>Evaluating Rules</h1></center>

<blockquote>All fuzzy evaluations are performed by a fuzzy engine. This
Java class allows parsing and evaluation of fuzzy rules. The following
example illustrates the main steps necessary for performing a fuzzy evaluation:
<blockquote>1. Create linguistic variables and define membership functions
<pre><code>
Factory factory = Factory.getFactory();
LinguisticVariable angle = factory.makeLinguisticVariable("angle");
angle.add("negative",-3.14,-3.14,0,0);
angle.add("positive",0,0,3.14,3.14);
LinguisticVariable power = factory.makeLinguisticVariable("power");
power.add("decreased",-2,-1,-1,0);
power.add("increased",0,1,1,2);
</code></pre>
<p>2. Create a fuzzy context
<pre><code>
FuzzyState state = factory.makeFuzzyState();
</code></pre>
<p>3. Register all linguistic variables
<pre><code>
state.register(angle);
state.register(power);
</code></pre>
<p>4. Load and parse rules
<pre><code>
Reader ruleTextReader = /* create a java.io.Reader to the text rules */ ;
RuleBlock ruleBlock = fuzzyState.createRuleExecutionSet(ruleTextReader);
</code></pre>
<p>5. Peform fuzzy evaluations
<pre><code>
ruleBlock.executeRules();
</code></pre>
<p>6. Obtain the result(s)
<pre><code>double result = power.defuzzify();
</code></pre></blockquote>
Linguistic variables must be defined (registered) before parsing can occur.  Parsing is performed on a java.io.Reader to provide a great deal of flexibility in how rules are loaded. The RuleBlock may be used to execute the rules over and over.</blockquote>
